# Product Context: Kitchen Utensils Chatbot

## Why This Project Exists
Many adult social care users struggle to identify, select, or safely use kitchen utensils. Existing resources are not conversational, lack semantic understanding, and do not support image-based queries.

## Problems Solved
- Provides clear, accessible answers about utensils
- Handles varied phrasing and misspellings
- Offers robust logic and fuzzy safety reasoning (FOL negation, canonical property parsing, default sharpness, robust fuzzy routing, dual-path fuzzy membership fallback)
- Identifies utensils from images (CNN: excellent performance, YOLO: under development)
- Demo utensils validated for all fuzzy safety levels (kitchenknife, woodenspoon, ladle)

## User Experience Goals
- Fast, accurate, and friendly responses
- Stateless, concise, and easy to understand
- Robust to spelling, phrasing, and input errors
- Seamless fallback between modules
- Support for both text and image queries 
- Robust logic/fuzzy reasoning for all demo utensils

## Current Status & Challenges
### **✅ Production Ready - All Critical Issues Resolved**
- **✅ Core Functionality**: All systems operational with excellent performance
- **✅ User Experience**: Clean, professional interface implemented
- **✅ Debug Capabilities**: Complete technical information available for development
- **✅ Data Quality**: CSV formatting and QnA response issues resolved
- **✅ Logic Reasoning**: Material inference and universal quantification implemented
- **✅ Message Suppression**: Verbose library output controlled for production deployment

### **Vision System Status**
- **CNN Classification**: 96.73% accuracy, excellent real-world performance, production ready
- **Original YOLO Detection**: 97.2% mAP50 on single-object detection, proven effective
- **Enhanced YOLO**: 76.6% mAP50 on combined dataset, but poor real-world performance due to synthetic dataset quality issues

### **Optional Enhancement Opportunities**
The enhanced multi-object YOLO model shows strong training metrics but struggles with real-world images:
- Only 12 detections across 16 test photos
- Low confidence scores (0.26-0.66 range)
- Missing obvious objects in natural kitchen environments
- Domain gap between synthetic training data and real deployment scenarios

### **Quality Lessons Learned**
- Training metrics can be misleading without real-world validation
- Synthetic dataset quality is critical - poor synthetic data can hurt rather than help
- Domain alignment between training and deployment environments is essential
- High-quality training data is more important than quantity
- Production readiness requires comprehensive user experience testing

**Current Status**: ✅ **PRODUCTION READY** - All critical functionality implemented with clean user interface. Enhanced YOLO improvements identified as optional enhancement opportunity. The project demonstrates both technical excellence and the importance of real-world validation in production systems.

Vision capabilities: CNN classification excellent and production-ready. Original YOLO proven effective. Enhanced YOLO training complete with important lessons about synthetic data quality - optional improvement opportunity for future development.
