# Product Context: Kitchen Utensils Chatbot

## Project Scope: University Module Assessment
**IMPORTANT**: This project is developed for a university module assessment to demonstrate AI/ML implementation skills and software engineering practices. The focus is on technical competency and academic learning objectives, not production deployment.

## Why This Project Exists (Academic Context)
This project demonstrates the integration of multiple AI technologies in a cohesive system:
- Natural Language Processing (AIML, TF-IDF, embeddings)
- Computer Vision (CNN classification, YOLO detection)
- Logic and Fuzzy Reasoning (FOL, fuzzy safety assessment)
- Software Engineering Best Practices (modular design, error handling, testing)

## Problems Solved (Technical Demonstration)
- Multi-modal AI pipeline integration with robust fallback mechanisms
- Handles varied phrasing and misspellings through multiple NLP approaches
- Demonstrates logic reasoning with FOL negation, canonical property parsing, and material inference
- Shows computer vision capabilities with both classification and detection
- Implements clean user experience with production/debug mode separation
- Validates all demo utensils for fuzzy safety levels (kitchenknife, woodenspoon, ladle)

## Academic Learning Goals
- **AI Integration**: Seamless combination of NLP, Computer Vision, and Logic systems
- **Robust Design**: Graceful degradation when components fail
- **User Experience**: Professional interface design with technical debug capabilities
- **Software Engineering**: Modular architecture, error handling, and maintainable code
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive technical documentation and user guides
