# Progress: Kitchen Utensils Chatbot

## What Works
- AIML pattern matching for all utensil classes
- TF-IDF similarity with comprehensive QnA coverage
- Embedding fallback (spaCy) for semantic matching
- Input normalization (case, punctuation, contractions, spelling correction)
- Debug output for routing and confidence scores
- Logic engine (FOL, NLTK) for fact checking (robust tilde negation)
- Fuzzy safety (Simpful) for utensil safety queries (sharpness/grip, dual-path membership fallback)
- Canonical property parsing for multi-word properties (CamelCase)
- Default sharpness is now 5.0 (medium) for fuzzy demo utensils
- Router always routes logic/fuzzy before NLP
- Demo utensils for all fuzzy safety levels: kitchenknife (low), woodenspoon (high), ladle (moderate)
- Dev tool for KB integrity (build_kb.py)
- Unit tests for logic/fuzzy
- **CNN image classifier OPTIMIZED and COMPLETE**: ResNet50V2 with 96.73% test accuracy
- **CNN Optimization Journey**: Thorough parameter analysis → Conservative optimization → Validation of diminishing returns
- **Optimal CNN Parameters**: Learning rate 0.0003, Dense 256 neurons, Dropout 0.3, 224x224 input
- **Enhanced image input handling**: Dual approach with direct syntax and natural language trigger
  - Direct syntax: "image: path/to/image.jpg"
  - Natural language: "What is in this image?" (opens file dialog box)
  - Specific phrase trigger with tkinter file dialog and image type filters
- Vision_reply function with confidence-based responses
- Complete dataset preparation for both CNN and YOLO approaches
- Dataset conversion and verification scripts
- Comprehensive model comparison and testing scripts
- Parameter optimization methodology and documentation
- Proper dataset citation and acknowledgments in README.md
- **YOLOv8 TRAINED AND OPERATIONAL**: Single-object detection with 97.2% mAP50
- **Multi-Object Dataset Generation System**: Comprehensive augmentation pipeline implemented
  - Object extraction from single-object YOLO data with intelligent cropping
  - Realistic multi-object scene composition with kitchen-specific placement rules
  - Albumentations integration for kitchen-specific augmentations (lighting, blur, shadows)
  - Generated 447 multi-object training scenes (307 train, 97 valid, 43 test)
  - Combined dataset: 1,788 total images with 25% multi-object scenes
  - Kitchen background generation with realistic countertop colors and textures
  - Size-based placement hierarchy (large items first, realistic spatial relationships)
  - Object grouping preferences (utensil sets, cooking tools, prep tools, containers)

## What's Left to Build
- **NEXT: Train enhanced YOLO model** on combined single+multi-object dataset
- Performance comparison between original and enhanced multi-object YOLO
- Multi-object detection validation and performance analysis
- Enhanced image input interface (drag-and-drop, batch processing)
- Unit tests for vision modules, polish, and final documentation

## Current Status
- **Milestone 7 COMPLETE**: CNN Image Classifier optimized and finalized at 96.73% test accuracy
- **YOLOv8 Single-Object COMPLETE**: 97.2% mAP50 baseline performance achieved
- **Multi-Object Enhancement COMPLETE**: Sophisticated dataset augmentation system implemented
- **Ready for Enhanced Training**: Combined dataset prepared with 25% multi-object scenes
- **Albumentations Integration**: Kitchen-specific augmentation pipeline configured
- **Dataset Composition**: 1,228 train + 388 valid + 172 test images
- CNN fully integrated into chatbot with image input handling
- YOLO dataset enhanced with realistic multi-object training data
- System robust for utensil QnA, semantic, logic, fuzzy, and high-performance vision queries
- **Next Step**: Train enhanced YOLO model for improved multi-object detection

## Known Issues
- Enhanced YOLO model not yet trained on combined dataset
- No persistent user state or web interface
- Image input is CLI-based only (no GUI)
- Multi-object performance not yet validated against baseline

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Raised TF-IDF fallback threshold to 0.65 for better embedding use
- Lowered embedding threshold to 0.6 for improved semantic fallback
- Centralized threshold management for easier tuning
- Expanded QnA and improved normalization for accuracy
- Added FOL logic, fuzzy safety, and dev tools for KB integrity
- Robust FOL negation, canonical property parsing, default sharpness=5.0, robust fuzzy routing, dual-path fuzzy membership fallback, and demo utensils for all fuzzy safety levels
- Added proper dataset citation in README.md with corrected URL
- Prepared dual approach: CNN for single-label classification, YOLO for multi-object detection
- Created reproducible dataset preparation workflow with conversion scripts
- **CNN Architecture Evolution**: MobileNetV3 (12%) → ResNet50V2 initial (94.48%) → ResNet50V2 optimized (96.73%)
- **Parameter Optimization Methodology**: Analysis-driven conservative optimization proved most effective
- **Optimization Lesson**: Aggressive optimization counterproductive at high baseline performance
- **YOLO Enhancement Strategy**: Multi-object augmentation through intelligent scene composition rather than simple data multiplication
- **Augmentation Philosophy**: Kitchen-specific, realistic placement over generic augmentation
- **Dataset Balance**: 25% multi-object ratio provides substantial multi-object training without overwhelming single-object baseline
