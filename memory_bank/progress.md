# Progress: Kitchen Utensils Chatbot

## What Works
- AIML pattern matching for all utensil classes
- TF-IDF similarity with comprehensive QnA coverage
- Embedding fallback (spaCy) for semantic matching
- Input normalization (case, punctuation, contractions, spelling correction)
- Debug output for routing and confidence scores
- Logic engine (FOL, NLTK) for fact checking (robust tilde negation)
- Fuzzy safety (Simpful) for utensil safety queries (sharpness/grip, dual-path membership fallback)
- Canonical property parsing for multi-word properties (CamelCase)
- Default sharpness is now 5.0 (medium) for fuzzy demo utensils
- Router always routes logic/fuzzy before NLP
- Demo utensils for all fuzzy safety levels: kitchenknife (low), woodenspoon (high), ladle (moderate)
- Dev tool for KB integrity (build_kb.py)
- Unit tests for logic/fuzzy
- **CNN image classifier OPTIMIZED and COMPLETE**: ResNet50V2 with 96.73% test accuracy
- **CNN Optimization Journey**: Thorough parameter analysis → Conservative optimization → Validation of diminishing returns
- **Optimal CNN Parameters**: Learning rate 0.0003, Dense 256 neurons, Dropout 0.3, 224x224 input
- Image input handling in chatbot (syntax: "image: path/to/image.jpg")
- Vision_reply function with confidence-based responses
- Complete dataset preparation for both CNN and YOLO approaches
- Dataset conversion and verification scripts
- Comprehensive model comparison and testing scripts
- Parameter optimization methodology and documentation
- Proper dataset citation and acknowledgments in README.md

## What's Left to Build
- YOLOv8 object detection training and integration (Milestone 8 - final vision component)
- Multi-object detection capabilities
- Performance comparison between CNN and YOLO
- Enhanced image input interface (drag-and-drop, batch processing)
- Unit tests for vision modules, polish, and final documentation

## Current Status
- **Milestone 7 COMPLETE**: CNN Image Classifier optimized and finalized at 96.73% test accuracy
- **CNN Training Status**: Complete and optimal - no further improvements needed
- **Best Model**: ResNet50V2 with conservative optimizations (cnn_model.h5)
- **Architecture Proven**: ResNet50V2 dramatically superior to MobileNetV3 (96.73% vs 12% baseline)
- **Parameter Optimization**: Conservative approach proved optimal vs aggressive optimization attempts
- CNN fully integrated into chatbot with image input handling
- Both YOLO and CNN datasets organized with train/valid/test splits
- System robust for utensil QnA, semantic, logic, fuzzy, and high-performance vision queries
- Ready for YOLOv8 implementation (Milestone 8) - final vision component

## Known Issues
- YOLOv8 model not yet trained or integrated
- No persistent user state or web interface
- Image input is CLI-based only (no GUI)
- Some edge cases in CNN predictions (acceptable at 96.73% accuracy)

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Raised TF-IDF fallback threshold to 0.65 for better embedding use
- Lowered embedding threshold to 0.6 for improved semantic fallback
- Centralized threshold management for easier tuning
- Expanded QnA and improved normalization for accuracy
- Added FOL logic, fuzzy safety, and dev tools for KB integrity
- Robust FOL negation, canonical property parsing, default sharpness=5.0, robust fuzzy routing, dual-path fuzzy membership fallback, and demo utensils for all fuzzy safety levels
- Added proper dataset citation in README.md with corrected URL
- Prepared dual approach: CNN for single-label classification, YOLO for multi-object detection
- Created reproducible dataset preparation workflow with conversion scripts
- **CNN Architecture Evolution**: MobileNetV3 (12%) → ResNet50V2 initial (94.48%) → ResNet50V2 optimized (96.73%)
- **Parameter Optimization Methodology**: Analysis-driven conservative optimization proved most effective
- **Optimization Lesson**: Aggressive optimization counterproductive at high baseline performance
