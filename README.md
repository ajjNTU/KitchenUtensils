**University Module Assessment Project**

A conversational assistant that demonstrates multi-modal AI integration through kitchen utensil queries, logical reasoning, and image recognition. This project showcases AI/ML implementation skills and software engineering best practices for academic assessment.

**Project Scope:** University module assessment - demonstrates technical competency in AI/ML integration and software engineering practices. Not intended for production deployment.

**Core Technologies Demonstrated:**
- **Natural Language Processing**: AIML pattern matching, TF-IDF similarity, semantic embeddings (spaCy)
- **Computer Vision**: CNN classification (96.73% accuracy), YOLO object detection (97.2% mAP50)
- **Logic & Fuzzy Reasoning**: First-order logic with material inference, fuzzy safety assessment
- **Software Engineering**: Modular architecture, error handling, graceful degradation, clean user interface

**Academic Learning Objectives:**
- Multi-modal AI pipeline integration (NLP + Computer Vision + Logic)
- Robust fallback mechanisms and error handling
- User experience design (production vs debug modes)
- Code quality and maintainability principles

**Assessment:** ISYS37101 Artificial Intelligence for Data Science Coursework

## Quick Start
```bash
# Production mode (clean interface)
python main.py

# Debug mode (technical details)
python main.py --debug
```

## Install
```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_md
```

**Tested on Python 3.10.x**

## Example Queries
- What is a wood spoon?
- What can I use a knife for?
- What drains pasta?
- What does a colander do?
- How do you use a blender?
- I know that wood is microwave safe (logic assertion)
- Check that woodenspoon is microwave safe (logic inference)
- How safe is a kitchenknife? (fuzzy reasoning)
- What is in this image? (CNN classification)
- Detect everything in this image (YOLO detection)
